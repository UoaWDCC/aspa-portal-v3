# User Routes:

This markdown file outlines and explains all user-related endpoints, 
as well as indicating the "weakest" role that is able to access the endpoint, 
i.e., 
guests (no role/session) can only access endpoints with (user/guest), 
users can access (user) and (user/guest) endpoints, 
and admins can access all endpoints.

## Summary

* Get all users (admin)
  + Get all user names (admin)
  + Get number of users (user/guest)

* Get user based on ID (THE user)

* Get all events for a particular user (THE user)
  + Get upcoming events for particular user (THE user)
  + Get past events for a particular user (THE user)

* Get all tickets for a certain user (THE user)
  + Get all unpaid tickets for a certain user (THE user)
  + Get all paid tickets for a certain user (THE user)

* Create a user (ONLY guest)

* Update a user i.e., user details (THE user)
  + Update user into admin (admin)

* Delete a user (THE user)

> Note: Many of these endpoints returns data in the http response 
> (specifically, events, users, and tickets) as a (or array of) json object(s).
> PLEASE check the schema.prisma file for the specific accessible fields
> of these json objects (including optional ones) - it should be the source of truth for telling
> you what fields you can access from each of these objects (apart from using console.log()).

> Additional note: I added some syntax here where (THE user) means that 
> only the user associated with the resource they are requesting can 
> access the endpoint, not any other user
